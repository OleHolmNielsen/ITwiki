NVIDIA InfiniBand Adapter (SharedIO)
=======================================

The SD665_V3_ has a water-cooled NVIDIA 2-Port PCIe Gen5 x16 InfiniBand Adapter (SharedIO) 
`ThinkSystem NVIDIA ConnectX-7 NDR200 InfiniBand QSFP112 Adapters <https://lenovopress.lenovo.com/lp1693-thinksystem-nvidia-connectx-7-ndr200-infiniband-qsfp112-adapters>`_.
The adapter is located in the right-hand SD665_V3_ node and connects both servers in the tray.

There is important information regarding SharedIO for older SD650 servers in the article 
`Considerations when using ThinkSystem SD650, SD650 V2, SD650 V3 and ConnectX-6 HDR, ConnectX-7 NDR SharedIO <https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht510888-thinksystem-sd650-and-connectx-6-hdr-sharedio-lenovo-servers-and-storage>`_.
The issues have apparently been resolved in the SD665_V3_ system.
